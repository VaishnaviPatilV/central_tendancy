# central_tendancy

📘 Project Overview

The project is a practical implementation of statistical concepts in Python.
It reads the Titanic dataset, explores its structure, and computes central tendency measures to summarize important characteristics of passenger demographics and ticket information.
It also provides basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using descriptive statistics.

🌟 Features

Load and inspect the Titanic dataset using Pandas
Display dataset structure (info, describe, columns, head, tail)

Compute Mean, Median, and Mode for numerical columns:
Age
Fare
Parch
SibSp
Pclass
Print results in a clear, structured format
Utilize visual and statistical Python libraries for analysis

🧰 Core Libraries Used

Library	Purpose
pandas	For data loading, manipulation, and descriptive statistics
numpy	For numerical operations
matplotlib.pyplot	For visualization (optional, though imported)
seaborn	For enhanced plotting and styling (optional, though imported)
scipy.stats	For statistical calculations (imported, optional)

🧾 Summary

The notebook effectively demonstrates how to compute measures of central tendency using Python.
It helps understand:

The central values of dataset features
How these values can describe the dataset’s overall behavior
The importance of statistical summaries before advanced analysis or modeling
This project provides a foundational step in data exploration and preprocessing for any data science or machine learning task.
